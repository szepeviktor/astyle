    <h1>Artistic Style Source Repositories</h1>

    <h2>Git</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://gitlab.com/saalen/astyle/-/tree/master">Git repository</a> is located at Gitlab. This repo is used for day to day development. The SVN repo mentioned below is kept up to date regularly.
    </p>

    <h2>Subversion</h2>

    <p>
        The <a href="https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/">SVN repository</a> is located at SourceForge. The intermediate
        source files have not been through the extensive system tests that are done before each release. Use reasonable
        precautions when using source code from the repository.</p>
    <p>
        The current version is in the "trunk/AStyle" branch of the repository. The file and directory names are case
        sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyle"&nbsp;
            "$HOME/astyle"</strong></p>
    <p>
        You can also <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/astyle/code/HEAD/tree/" target="_blank" title="open new window">browse
            the subversion repository</a>. The current development release is in the "trunk" directory. This gives you
        a view into the current status of the project's code without actually checking-out the files.</p>

    <h3>Other Projects</h3>

    <p>
        Two additional Artistic Style projects are available in the repository. They are not maintained for the general
        public, but are available if you want them. You may have to create your own project files and scripts to use
        them.</p>
    <p>
        All projects, and any additional source required, should be installed in the same top level folder. A sample file
        directory containing ALL the projects should look as follows. The project dependencies are described
        below.</p>
