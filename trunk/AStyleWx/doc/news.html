    <h1>Artistic Style Wx News</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Artistic Style Wx 3.2&nbsp; (pending)</h3>

    <p>
        The Artistic Style source code has been updated to use C++11. It will need Visual Studio 2015 or GCC 5 or higher
        to compile.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Artistic Style static and shared builds now both use the same &quot;AStyleWx&quot; configuration file. 
        The configuration file for the shared library can be removed. The file for Windows is in the registry under 
        \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\AStyleWxDll. The file for Linux is a hidden file in the user directory named 
        <strong>.</strong>astylewxso.</p>
    <p>
        The current files can now be retained and opened automatically in the next session. There is detailed information
        on the index.html page.</p>
    <p>
        A new &quot;webkit&quot; style option has been added. It is similar to the Stroustrup brace style except the
        'else' keyword is attached to the previous closing bracket.</p>
    <p>
        Some Linux distribution packages are now offering the GTK3 toolkit in their wxWidgets packages. AStyleWx has 
        been changed to improve the GTK3 displays. But the wxWidgets display is not as good as with GTK2. The sizing 
        of dialog boxes and some of the widgets is not as good as it could be. A GTK3 distribution package can be 
        used, but the GTK2 display will be better. </p>
    <p>
        A Linux test version of wxWidgets is now available along with the different gtk toolkits. It is possible to 
        have more than one version installed at the same time. The version to use in a compile is selected using the 
        wx-config script. To change the default version the utility &quot;update-alternatives&quot; can be used. AStyleWx
        also 
        allows for a different version to be selected at compile time. The Install documentation has descriptions on 
        how to do this. The information is new so be sure to check if you are installing more than one wxWidgets 
        distribution. The wxWidgets version used to compile can be obtained from the AStyleWX Help. About menu.</p>
    <p>
        The cmake options file has been changed to use the cmake wxWidgets commands. The Install documentation has 
        information on the install procedures. There are a few changes and additions.</p>
    <p>
        In some circumstances on Linux you may get a runtime error of &quot;Mismatch between the program and library build
        versions detected&quot;. There in a new topic in the &quot;Install Instructions&quot; titled &quot;Linux Library
        Runtime Error&quot; that describes a fix for the error.
