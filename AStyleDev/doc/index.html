    <h1>
        Artistic Style Developer Information</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        Artistic Style has compile options for creating a shared library (DLL) or static library for use with a Graphical
        User Interface (GUI). The shared library can be called from a C++, C#, or Python &nbsp;program. There are also
        compile options for a Java Native Interface (JNI) that allows it to be called from a Java program. Information
        on compiling the various configurations of Artistic Style is in the Install Information.</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        Source code for all examples and the test files can be downloaded below or obtained from the Subversion repository.
        These projects also require the source from Artistic Style in addition to the development examples. There is information
        on checking files out of the repository on the Artistic Style <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/subversion.html">
            Subversion</a> page.</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        &nbsp;You can also <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/">browse the subversion repository</a>.
        The current development release is in the "trunk" directory. This gives you a view of the project's code without
        actually checking-out the files.</p>

    <h3>
        Examples</h3>

    <p>
        Source code from the following examples can be copied and pasted into an editor or development environment for
        compiling and running. Or it can be downloaded from the "Source Code Downloads" below. The code highlighting for
        the Examples was done with <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.andre-simon.de/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result"

    <h3>
        Source Code Downloads</h3>

    <p>
        The downloads contain the above example source files and the test data. The test data is the same for all downloads.</p>

    <h4>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/example2-cpp_2.03.zip">C++ Example</a></h4>

    <p>
        Compile Artistic Style as a shared or static library using the macro ASTYLE_LIB. Compile Example.cpp as an executable
        and link it to the library. It will format 'cpp' and 'h' files in the test-c directory.</p>

    <h4>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/example2-sharp_2.03.zip">Objective-C
            Example</a></h4>

    <p>
        Th example2 for Objective-C includes an AStyleInterface class that builds the option string and contains the methods
        to call the shared library using a C# program. Compile Artistic Style as a shared library using the macro ASTYLE_LIB.
        Copy the shared library to the same folder as the C# class files (C# does a Windows type search for the shared
        library, looking first in the startup program's directory). It will format C# files in the test-s directory.</p>

    <h4>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/example2-java_2.03.zip">Java Example</a></h4>

    <p>
        The example for Java includes an AStyleInterface class that builds the option string and contains the methods
        to call the shared library using the Java Native Interface (JNI). Artistic Style must be compiled as a shared
        library using the macro ASTYLE_JNI. Copy the shared library to the same folder as the Java class files (it is
        loaded from the classpath directory). It will format java files in the test-j directory.</p>

    <h4>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/example2-sharp_2.03.zip">C# Example</a></h4>

    <p>
        Th example2 for C# includes an AStyleInterface class that builds the option string and contains the methods to call
        the shared library using a C# program. Compile Artistic Style as a shared library using the macro ASTYLE_LIB.
        Copy the shared library to the same folder as the C# class files (C# does a Windows type search for the shared
        library, looking first in the startup program's directory). It will format C# files in the test-s directory.</p>

    <h4>
        <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/trunk/AStyleDev/downloads/examples-python_2.03.zip">Python
            Examples</a></h4>

    <p>
        This download contains three Python scripts. The script ExampleExe.py calls an Artistic Style executable to format
        C++ source code. The scripts ExampleByte.py and ExampleUnicode.py call the Artistic Style shared library. The
        executable and shared library must be compiled using the macro ASTYLE_LIB. Copy the executable and shared library
        to the same folder as the Python scripts. They will format C++ files in the test-c directory included in the download.</p>
