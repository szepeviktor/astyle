    <h1>
        Artistic Style Developer Information</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        Artistic Style has compile options for creating a shared library (DLL) or static library for use with a Graphical
        User Interface (GUI). The shared library can be called from a C++, Objective&#8209;C, C#, or Python program. There
        are also compile options for a Java Native Interface (JNI) that allows it to be called from a Java program. Information
        on compiling the various configurations of Artistic Style is in the Install Information.</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        The following Examples show how to call the Artistic Style shared library using the various programming languages.
        They are command line programs and do NOT contain a Graphical User Interface for the Artistic Style options. Their
        purpose is to demonstrate the various calling procedures.</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        Source code for all examples and the test files can be downloaded below or obtained from the Subversion repository.
        These projects also require the source from Artistic Style in addition to the development examples. There is information
        on checking files out of the repository on the Artistic Style <a href="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/subversion.html">
            Subversion</a> page.</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        You can also <a href="http://astyle.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/astyle/">browse the subversion repository</a>.
        The current development release is in the "trunk" directory. This gives you a view of the project's code without
        actually checking-out the files.</p>

    <h3>
        Examples</h3>

    <p>
        Source code from the following examples can be copied and pasted into an editor or development environment for
        compiling and running. Or the source code can be downloaded from the "Source Code Downloads" section below. The
        code highlighting for the example html pages was done with <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.andre-simon.de/&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=1&ct=result"

        Source Code Downloads</h3>

    <p>
        The downloads contain the above example source files and the test data. The test data is the same for all downloads.</p>

    <h4>
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/examples/example-cpp/example-cpp_2.04.zip" target="astyle"
            title="open new window">C++ Example</a></h4>

    <p>
        The example for C++ contains the methods to call Artistic Style from a static or shared library using a C++ program.
        Compile Artistic Style as a static or shared library using the macro ASTYLE_LIB. Copy the shared library to the
        same folder as the C++ Example executable. Compile Example.cpp as an executable and link it to the library. It
        will format files in the test&#8209;data directory included in the download.</p>

            title="open new window"">Objective&#8209;C Example</a></h4>

    <p>
        The example for Objective&#8209;C contains the methods to call Artistic Style from a static or shared library
        using an Objective&#8209;C program. Compile Artistic Style as a static or shared llibrary using the macro ASTYLE_LIB.
        Copy the shared library to the same folder as the Objective&#8209;C Example executable. It will format files in
        the test&#8209;data directory included in the download.</p>

            title="open new window"">Java Example</a></h4>

    <p>
        The example for Java includes an AStyleInterface class that calls the shared library using the Java Native Interface
        (JNI). Artistic Style must be compiled as a shared library using the macro ASTYLE_JNI. Copy the shared library
        to the same folder as the Java class files (it is loaded from the classpath directory). It will format files in
        the test&#8209;data directory included in the download.</p>

    <h4>
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/examples/example-sharp/example-sharp_2.04.zip"
            target="astyle" title="open new window"">C# Example</a></h4>

    <p>
        The example for C# includes an AStyleInterface class that calls the shared library using a C# program. Compile
        Artistic Style as a shared library using the macro ASTYLE_LIB. Copy the shared library to the same folder as the
        C# class files (C# does a Windows type search for the shared library, looking first in the startup program's directory).
        It will format files in the test&#8209;data directory included in the download.</p>

    <p>
        This download contains three Python scripts. The script ExampleExe.py calls an Artistic Style executable to format
        C++ source code. The scripts ExampleByte.py and ExampleUnicode.py call the Artistic Style shared library. The
        executable and shared library must be compiled using the macro ASTYLE_LIB. Copy the executable and shared library
        to the same folder as the Python scripts. They will format files in the test&#8209;data directory included in
        the download.</p>
