Starting with Visual Studio 2015:
    The AStyleTestCon LeakDetector test doesn't consistently work. 
	The "No memory leaks detected." message at the end of the run is not displayed.
	I don't know if memory leaks are checked or not.

As a temproary fix run Leakdetector with the option "--gtest_filter=-PrintF.*". 
	The problem is with the PrintF tests.

Visual Studio releases previous to 2015 don't have the problem.
