    <h3 id="_wx_wxWidgets_Compiles">wxWidgets Compiles</h3>

    <p>
        For all platforms use wxWidgets 3.0 and higher. AStyleWx will NOT compile with wxWidgets 2.8.</p>
    <p>
        AStyleWx expects a Unicode, non-Monolithic build. This is the default for WxWidgets 3.0 and higher and is usually
        the default for the Linux wxWidgets installation packages.</p>

    <h4 id="_wx_Linux">Linux</h4>

    <p>
        On Linux wxWidgets is available as installation packages. AStyleWx will work with the available packages if
        wxWidgets 3.0 or higher is used. You can install both versions 2.8 and 3.0 on the same system. Both the development
        packages and the run-time packages should be installed.</p>

    <h4 id="_wx_Mac_OS">Mac OS</h4>

    <p>
        Use wxWidgets 3.0 or higher. Mac OS must be compiled and installed from the source code using either Xcode or
        the command line tools. Download the source for Linux and Mac OS. Do NOT use a Windows download. It will have
        the
        wrong line endings which will cause problems.</p>
    <p>
        Build the library for cocoa. Install instructions are in wxWidgets docs/osx. The libraries are built with
        the default options macosx&#8209;version&#8209;min=10.5 and installs to /usr/local. Other possible configure
        flags are at <a href="http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Possible_Configure_Flags_under_OS_X" target="_blank"
            title="open new window">http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Possible_Configure_Flags_under_OS_X</a>.
        Either Xcode or the command line tools may be used. The Xcode install did NOT do a complete install with the
        tested release. The command line tools were the better choice. The AStyleWx compiles are built with wxWidgets
        static libraries from the default install folders.</p>
    <p>
        To build and install static libraries using the command line:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE: For wxWidgets-3.0.2, make and install needed the additional option 
            ignore&#8209;errors.</strong> The project that does not compile is not needed.</p>
    <pre>cd wxWxdgets-3.0.2
mkdir build-release
cd build-release
../configure --disable-shared
make
sudo make install</pre>

    <h4 id="_wx_Visual_Studio">Visual Studio</h4>

    <p>
        There are Visual Studio solution files for wxWidgets releases in the wxWidgets build\msw folder. All of the
        configurations and platforms in the wxWidgets solution files are supported by AStyleWx. Just open the appropriate
        solution file for your Visual Studio version and compile the configurations and platforms you want. The
        outputs will be in the various wxWidgets &quot;lib&quot; folders.</p>
    <p>
        The wxWidgets website has binary DLLs available for download. These were not used because the wxWidgets
        static libraries are not included. The binary DLLs can be used for the DLL files if you want, but the AStyleWx
        properties will need to be changed to the correct directories. The binaries are apparently compiled with the options
        OFFICIAL_BUILD, COMPILER_VERSION, and TARGET_CPU (and possibly others) while the solution file compiles are not.
        The properties that require changing are &quot;C/C++ &gt; General &gt; Additional Include Directories&quot; and
        &quot;Linker &gt; General &gt; Additional Library Directories&quot;. This may change, of course, with later 
        versions.</p>
    <p>
        Compiling wxWidgets 3.0.2 with Visual Studio 2015 requires making changes to the wxWidgets source files. A
        description of the solution is at <a href="https://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=40491"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">https://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=40491</a>.
        Use the reply by doublemax tagged as [SOLVED]. These changes are NOT needed for wxWidgets 3.1.0 and 
        higher.</p>
    <p>
        AStyleWx has a &quot;static&quot; build which is not available with the wxWidgets solutions. The Visual Studio
        wxWidgets project files can be modified by using the procedure described in the AStyleWx documentation <a href="static.html"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">Visual Studio Static Compile</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="_wx_Other_Windows_Compilers">Other Windows Compilers</h4>

    <p>
        Other Windows compilers will need to use the makefiles in the wxWidgets build\msw folder. With wxWidgets
        3 you can use the default options with the following exceptions. To build the wxWidgets static libraries no additional
        options are needed. To build the wxWidgets DLLs the option SHARED=1 should be used.</p>
    <p>
        Some compilers require compiling wxWidgets with C++11. If you need to compile with C++11, there is an important
        note in wxWidgets docs\msw\install.txt. <strong>Use &#8209;std=gnu++11 instead of &#8209;std=c++11</strong> because
        the latter disables some extensions that wxWidgets relies on. If this is not done the linker will fail with undefined
        references. &#8209;Wno-deprecated-declarations may also be needed to eliminate unwanted warning messages.</p>
    <p>
        To build wxWidgets DLLs with the TDM GCC compiler:</p>
    <pre>cd build\msw
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc SHARED=1 CXXFLAGS=&quot;-std=gnu++11 -Wno-deprecated-declarations&quot;</pre>

    <h3 id="_lnx_Linux_Compiles">Linux Compiles</h3>

    <p>
        wxWidgets can usually be installed with the package manager. The development package is needed as well as
        the shared libraries. Artistic Style Wx needs release 3.0 or higher. You can install versions 2.8 and 3.0 on the
        same system.</p>
    <p>
        The Linux makefiles use the wx-config script for information about wxWidgets. The DEFAULT release is used unless
        another is requested. Install locations as well as compiler and linker options are also obtained from the 
        script.</p>
    <p>
        To display the default release:</p>
    <pre>wx-config --release</pre>
    <p>
        To display a list of all installed releases:</p>
    <pre>wx-config --list</pre>
    <p>
        To get a list of other options:</p>
    <pre> wx-config --help</pre>

    <h4 id="_lnx_GCC_Makefile">GCC Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build the AStyleWx configurations use the makefile located in
        the astylewx/build/gcc directory. The executables will be in the astylewx/build/gcc/bin directory.
        The Artistic Style source is included in the AStyleWx compile.</p>

    <p>
        To build Artistic Style Wx change to the astylewx build/gcc directory. Before the first compile the deps.mak file
        should be regenerated to assure the correct version of wxWidgets headers is being used. It is regenerated using
        the &quot;deps&quot; target in the makefile. Wait for it to finish before doing the make.</p>

    <pre>cd astylewx/build/gcc
make deps
make</pre>

    <p>
        To build the other astylewx configurations you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. Entering "make astylewx"
        or "make release" will build the command line configuration. Following are the symbolic names and file names (in
        parens) of the various configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>release </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx command line program (astylewx). This is the default 
            option.</li>
        <li><strong>shared </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx program to use an astyle shared library 
            (astylewxso).</li>
        <li><strong>debug </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx command line program with debugging information 
            (astylewxd).</li>
        <li><strong>shareddebug </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx program to use an astyle shared library with debugging
            information (astylewxsod).</li>
        <li><strong>all </strong>builds all the above configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        More than one configuration can be built at the same time. For example, to build all the release configurations
        enter:</p>
    <pre>cd astyle/build/gcc
make release shared</pre>

    <p>
        The <a href="#_lnx_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile Options</a> and <a href="#_lnx_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other
            Makefile Targets</a> sections contain additional compile and target options.</p>

    <h4 id="_lnx_Clang_Makefile">Clang Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build AStyleWx use the makefile located in the astyle/build/clang
        directory. The executables will be in the astyle/build/clang/bin directory.
        The Artistic Style source is included in the AStyleWx compile.</p>

    <p>
        To build Artistic Style Wx change to the astylewx/build/clang directory. Before the first compile the deps.mak
        file should be regenerated to assure the correct version of wxWidgets headers is being used. It is regenerated
        using the &quot;deps&quot; target in the makefile. Wait for it to finish before doing the make.</p>
    <pre>cd astylewx/build/clang
make deps
make
</pre>

    <p>
        The <a href="#_lnx_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile Options</a> and <a href="#_lnx_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other
            Makefile Targets</a> sections contain additional compile and target options.</p>

    <h4 id="_lnx_Intel_Makefile">Intel Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        These procedures and the makefile are for recent versions of the compiler. They may not work for earlier versions.
        Instructions for your compiler are in the compiler documentation file "get_started_lc.htm".</p>
    <p>
        To compile the source there are environment variables that must be set by running the compiler environment script
        compilervars.sh (or compilervars.csh) with an argument that specifies the target architecture. If this has not
        been done already enter: "<strong>source &nbsp;&lt;install-dir&gt;/bin/compilervars.sh&nbsp;&lt;arg&gt;</strong>",
        where &lt;install-dir&gt; is the directory where the compiler is installed and &lt;arg&gt; is <strong>ia32 </strong>
        or <strong>intel64</strong>. If this is not done "make" will display an error message. On an Intel x64 platform
        installed in the default directory the instruction would be</p>
    <pre>source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64</pre>
    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build AStyleWx use the makefile located in the astyle/build/intel directory.
        The executables will be in the astyle/build/intel/bin directory. The Artistic Style source is included in the
        AStyleWx compile.</p>

    <p>
        To build Artistic Style Wx change to the astylewx/build/intel directory.
        Before the first compile the deps.mak file should be regenerated to assure the correct version of wxWidgets headers
        is being used. It is regenerated using the &quot;deps&quot; target in the makefile. Wait for it to finish before
        doing the make.</p>
    <pre>cd astylewx/build/intel
make deps
make
</pre>

    <p>
        The <a href="#_lnx_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile Options</a> and <a href="#_lnx_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other
            Makefile Targets</a> sections contain additional compile and target options.</p>

    <h4 id="_lnx_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile Options</h4>

    <p>
        The following additional compile options are available for GCC, Clang, Intel, and Mac OS.</p>

    <h5>wx</h5>

    <pre>wx=3.0</pre>

    <p>
        To compile with a wxWidgets release other than the default use the &quot;wx&quot; option. For example, if
        both releases 3.0 and 3.1 are installed, using &quot;wx=3.0&quot; will compile with wxWidgets release 3.0. This
        option may be used with compile and install commands.</p>

    <h5>CFLAGS</h5>


    <p>
        To add additional compiler options use CFLAGS. The options should be enclosed in quotes if spaces are 
        included.</p>

    <h5>LDFLAGS</h5>

    <p>
        To add additional linker options use LDFLAGS. The options should be enclosed in quotes if spaces are 
        included.</p>

    <h5>TESTMODE1</h5>

    <p>
        This is used in CFLAGS to bypass AStyleWx warning messages when changed files have not been saved. Its purpose
        is to make testing more convenient. It is not intended to be used in a release configuration. To use the option
        enter &quot;CFLAGS=&#8209;DTESTMODE1&quot;.</p>

    <h4 id="_lnx_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</h4>

    <p>
        The following additional makefile targets are available.</p>

    <h5>clean</h5>

    <p>
        Removes the object and executable files for all configurations.</p>
    <p>
        To remove the files for all configurations:</p>
    <pre>make clean
</pre>

    <h5>cleanobj</h5>

    <p>
        Removes the object files for all configurations. The executables will not be removed.</p>
    <p>
        To remove only the object files for all configurations:</p>
    <pre>make cleanobj
</pre>

    <h5>install</h5>

    <p>
        Installs the AStyleWx executable and documentation files. The default is /usr/bin for the executable and /usr/share/doc/astylewx
        for the documentation. You must have the appropriate permissions to use install.</p>
    <p>
        To install AStyleWx to the default directories:</p>
    <pre>sudo make install
</pre>
    <p>
        To install AStyleWx to a different directory, set a value for the macro $(prefix). For example, to install the
        executable to a user's home directory (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
    <pre>sudo make prefix=$HOME install
</pre>

    <h5>uninstall</h5>

    <p>
        Uninstalls the executable and documentation. You must have the appropriate permissions to use uninstall.</p>
    <p>
        To uninstall AStyleWx from the default directories:</p>
    <pre>sudo make uninstall
</pre>
    <p>
        To uninstall the files from a different directory set a value for the macro $(prefix). For example, to uninstall
        the files from a user's home directory (/home/<i>user</i>):</p>
    <pre>sudo make prefix=$HOME uninstall
</pre>
    <p>
        NOTE: The uninstall option will NOT remove the &quot;.astylewx&quot; configuration files from the user's home
        directory. The files must be removed individually for each user.</p>

    <h3 id="_mac_Mac_OS_Compiles">Mac OS Compiles</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> wxWidgets libraries are built with the standard C++ libraries, NOT the C++11 libraries.
        The AStyleWx files must be built with the standard libraries or you will get errors during linking.</p>

    <h4 id="_mac_Xcode">Xcode</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleWx and AStyleWxDy workspaces and project files for the Xcode development environment are available in the
        &quot;build/xcode&quot;
            directory. AStyleWx links AStyle as a static library, AStyleWxDy links AStyle as a dynamic library.</p>
    <p>
        The project files have Debug and Release configurations. The following projects are available in
        the AStyleWx workspace.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyleA</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library (libastyle.a). This will be statically
            linked with AStyleWx.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleWx</strong> builds the AStyleWx program. It will be linked with AStyleA to create the AStyleWx executable.
            This will build AStyleA first if necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The following projects are available in the AStyleWxDy workspace.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyleDy</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a dynamic library (libastyle-x.x.dylib). This will
            be dynamically linked with AStyleWxDy at runtime.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleWxDy</strong> builds the AStyleWx program. It will be dynamically linked with AStyleDy to create
            the AStyleWxDy executable. This will build AStyleDy first if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Build and run the program as usual from Xcode.</p>

    <h5>install</h5>

    <p>
        The following instructions are for the AStyleWx applications. The app will be installed in the Applications
        directory. You must have the appropriate permissions to use install.</p>
    <p>
        To install the
        AStyleWx app to the Applications directory:</p>
    <pre>cd astylewx/build/xcode
sudo xcodebuild install -project AStyleWx.xcodeproj -target AStyleWx
</pre>

    <h5>uninstall</h5>

    <p>
        To uninstall remove AStyleWx.app from the Applications folder.</p>

    <h4 id="_mac_Makefile">Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build the AStyleWx configurations use the makefile located in the astylewx/build/mac
        directory. The executables will be in the astylewx/build/mac/bin directory. The Artistic Style source is included
        in the AStyleWx compile.</p>
    <p>
        To build Artistic Style Wx change to the astylewx build mac directory. Before the first compile the deps.mak
        file should be regenerated to assure the correct version of wxWidgets headers is being used. It is regenerated
        using the &quot;deps&quot; target in the makefile. Wait for it to finish before doing the make.</p>
    <pre>cd astylewx/build/mac
make deps
make</pre>
    <p>
        To build the other astylewx configurations you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. Entering &quot;make
        astylewx&quot; or &quot;make release&quot; will build the command line configuration. Following are the symbolic
        names and file names (in parens) of the various configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>release </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx command line program (astylewx). This is the default option.
        </li>
        <li><strong>shared </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx program to use an astyle shared library (astylewxso).
        </li>
        <li><strong>debug </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx command line program with debugging information (astylewxd).
        </li>
        <li><strong>shareddebug </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx program to use an astyle shared library with debugging
            information
            (astylewxsod).</li>
        <li><strong>all </strong>builds all the above configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        More than one configuration can be built at the same time. For example, to build all the release configurations

        <strong>To compile AStyleWx the wxWidgetsMacros.props files must be changed.</strong> The files
        are located in the build\vs... folders. The easiest way to change them is to
        open the props files in a text editor. Then change the "WXWIN" field to the location of the wxWidgets directory
        on your system. The &quot;wxVersion&quot; field will need to be changed if it does not contain the correct wxWidgets
        version.</p>
    <p>
        The &quot;wxWidgetsMacros.props&quot; files can also be changed from the &quot;Properties Editor&quot; in Visual
        Studio. An AStyleWx solution must be open. Open the &quot;Property Manager&quot; window from the View
        menu. Open a configuration in the Property Manager, right click on &quot;wxWidgets Macros&quot;, and select &quot;Properties&quot;.
        Under &quot;Common Properties&quot; select &quot;User Macros&quot;. The &quot;WXWIN&quot; and &quot;wxVersion&quot;
        macros values will be displayed. They can be changed by double-clicking on the field name. Change the macro value
        to the correct value for your system and press OK. This will change the macros for all configurations. The properties
        file needs to be saved before closing the solution.</p>
    <p>
        The following solution files are available.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyleWx_3.x </strong>builds Artistic Style Wx for version 3.x of wxWidgets, where x is the minor
            version number. Artistic Style is compiled and linked as a Static Library (astylelib.lib). The build will result
            in a single file executable.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleWxDll_3.x </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx program for version 3.x of wxWidgets, where x is
            the minor version number. . Artistic Style is compiled and linked as a Dynamic Link Library (AStyle.dll). This
            will also build an exports library and a static library for linking the dll. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        All projects have the following configurations available for Win32 and x64 platforms.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Debug</strong> builds a debug configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets static libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Release</strong> builds a release configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets static 
            libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>DLL Debug</strong> builds a debug configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets DLL libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>DLL Release</strong> builds a release configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets DLL 
            libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Static</strong> builds a release configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets static libraries
            and is also linked to a static runtime library.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To compile a configuration, the corresponding library files must be available in the wxWidgets directory. All
        library file compiles are available in the wxWidgets solution files except the Static compile. If the Static
        compile is not needed it can be removed from the configurations. If you want to try compiling it the procedure
        described in the AStyleWx documentation <a href="static.html">Visual Studio Static Compile</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="_win_Other_Compilers">Other Compilers</h4>

    <p>
        To use other compilers a project file must be built using a development environment.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a project using the compiler development environment.</li>
        <li>Add to the project all the AStyleWx .cpp and .h files in the "src" and &quot;dialog&quot; directories.</li>
        <li>Add to the project all the AStyle .cpp and .h files in the &quot;AStyle\src&quot; directory.</li>
        <li>Define the Preprocessor Definition ASTYLE_LIB for all Configurations and Platforms.</li>
        <li>The Compiler Options section discusses the compiler options to use.</li>
        <li>Compile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The AStyle source can also be compiled as a separate static library and linked to the AStyleWx compile.</p>

    <h3 id="_win_Compiler_Options">Compiler Options</h3>

    <p>
        To compile AStyle as a static or shared (dynamic) library
        define the macro ASTYLE_LIB. To compile a Java shared (dynamic) library define the macro ASTYLE_JNI. The
        option ASTYLE_NO_EXPORTS is sometimes needed for static libraries to prevent compiler error and warning
        messages. Use the appropriate compiler and linker options to compile the static or shared library. Add debug
        options to compile the debug versions.</p>
    <p>
        Artistic Style is a small program and it is best to optimize for speed. The debug configurations are not usually
        optimized. To optimize for speed in the release configurations, use the macro NDEBUG to remove asserts. If
        necessary, use an option to activate the C++11 standards (--std=c++0x on GCC and MinGW). Use an option that allows
        inline function expansion. Runtime Type Information (RTTI) is NOT needed. Exceptions are not used. Use whole program
        optimization if your compiler supports it. There may be other options you can use depending
        on the compiler.</p>
