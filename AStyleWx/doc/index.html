    <p class="noindent">
        Artistic Style Wx (AStyleWx) was developed as a Graphical User Interface test program for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">Artistic Style</a>. It is licensed under the MIT license and built
        using wxWidgets version 3 or higher. It will run on Windows, Linux, or Mac. The source code is available to be
        used and modified for any purpose you choose. Developers using Artistic Style in another project may use any part
        of AStyleWx in their project. The modified source code does NOT need to be made available to others.</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        A compiled version of wxWidgets must be available for compiling and running AStyleWx. The <a href="install.html"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">Install Information</a> page has instructions for setting up wxWidgets
        and compiling the AStyleWx source code. A <a href="static.html" target="_blank" title="open new window">Visual Studio
            Static Compile</a> page has instructions for setting up the static compile that uses a static runtime library,
        no exception handling, and no runtime type information (RTTI).</p>
    <p class="noindent">
        The latest development files can be checked out from the Artistic Style repository using Subversion. 
        Files for the latest release can be downloaded from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astylewx.astyle.p/files/"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">Files</a> section on the AStyleWx SourceForge page. The
        Windows package contains a compiled binary. Other platforms will need to compile the source code. Makefiles are
        included for the most popular compilers. Follow the install instructions for the appropriate platform as described
        in the &quot;Install Information&quot; page.</p>

    <h3>RAD Tools for Dialogs</h3>

    <p>
        The Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool used to design the AStyleWx dialog interfaces is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">wxFormBuilder</a>. It allows separation of the generated and written
        code by using inheritance. I prefer this to having the code combined in the same source file as it seems like
        a safer way to do it. The wxFormBuilder files and the generated source code are in the AStyleWx &quot;dialog&quot;
        folder.</p>
    <p>
        Windows users can get the release 3.5.1 RC1 executable download from the SourceForge site. It has all the controls
        used by AStyleWx. Linux users may need to compile it from source. The most current version may not be 
        available as an install package. The most current <a href="https://github.com/marekr/wxFormBuilder"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">wxFormBuilder repository</a> is at GitHub instead of SourceForge.
        The wxFB3.5-RC1 GitHub branch is compatible with the wxFormBuilder 3.5 RC1 release. There are more up to date
        builds available in the repository if you want to use them.</p>
    <p>
        To compile 
        the Linux build, open a terminal in the top wxFormBuilder directory.</p>

    <pre>cmake CMakeLists.txt 
make 
sudo make install</pre>

    <p>
        You may need to create a menu item after the install.</p>
    <p>
        Another RAD tool that will work, with modifications, is <a href="http://wxcrafter.codelite.org/" target="_blank"
            title="open new window">wxCrafter</a>. It has a GUI similar to wxFormBuilder and generates code in similar
        manner. It expects the generated code to be used as a base class. But it does not convert the wxStyledTextCtrl,
        which will need to be rebuilt. It is being maintained so it may be a better choice. It can import an XRC file
        from any RAD application that will generate one.</p>
    <p>
        The main window for Artistic Style Wx does NOT use a RAD. It is created by written, not generated, code. The notebook
        control is actually a wxAuiNotebook which allows the user to rearrange the tab order using drag-and-drop.</p>

    <h3>Book Classes for Dialogs</h3>

    <p>
        wxFormBuilder generates wxNotebook (not wxAuiNotebook) controls for the Editor and AStyle dialog windows. 
        It uses tabs to change the dialog pages. AStyleWx makes use of the base class wxBookCtrl so the &quot;book&quot;
        class can be converted to wxChoiceBook, wxListBook, or wxTreeBook controls. This is done using the script 
        &quot;to_xxbook.py&quot;. This is a Python script available in the &quot;file-py&quot; folder. You must have Python
        installed to run it. In the script change the variable &quot;__new_book&quot; to the value of the desired book
        control and run the script. When recompiled the dialogs will display the new wxWidgets book control. The main
        window is NOT changed.</p>
