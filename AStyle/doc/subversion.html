    <h1>Artistic Style Subversion Repository</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Artistic Style</h3>

    <p>
        The latest development source is in the Artistic Style repository at SourceForge. It can be checked out using
        Subversion. The source code is under development and some changes take several weeks to complete. The intermediate
        source files have not been through the extensive system tests that are done before each release. Use reasonable
        precautions when using source code from the repository.</p>
    <p>
        The current version is in the "trunk/AStyle" branch of the repository. The file and directory names are case 
        sensitive.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyle"&nbsp; 
            "$HOME/astyle"</strong></p>
    <p>
        You can also <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/astyle/code/HEAD/tree/">browse the subversion repository</a>.
        The current development release is in the "trunk" directory. This gives you a view into the current status of
        the project's code without actually checking-out the files.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Other Projects</h3>

    <p>
        Two additional Artistic Style projects are available in the repository. They are not maintained for the general
        public but are available if you want them. You may have to create your own project files and scripts to use 
        them.</p>
    <p>
        All projects, and any additional source required, should be installed in the same top level folder. A sample file
        directory containing ALL the projects should look as follows. The project dependencies are described 
        below.</p>
    <pre>    Projects
        AStyle
        AStyleDev
        AStyleTest
        AStyleWx
        AStyleWxTest
        googlemock
        googletest</pre>

    <h4>AStyleDev</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleDev contains the development files that are made available in the "Developer Information" section. Refer
        to that section for more information.</p>
    <p>
        These projects require the Artistic Style project to compile.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleDev"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyledev"
        </strong></p>

    <h4>AStyleTest</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleTest contains the unit test programs and test scripts for Artistic Style. There are over 2000 tests in the
        main test program.</p>
    <p>
        This project requires the Artistic Style project to compile.
        In addition, the test program requires Google Mock and Google Test described below.</p>
    <p>
        The main test project, AStyleTest, can be run in Visual Studio using the graphical Visual Studio Test 
        Explorer. The procedure is described below.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleTest"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyletest"
        </strong></p>

    <h4>AStyleWx</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleTest contains a GUI test program for Artistic Style. </p>
    <p>
        This project requires the Artistic Style project to compile. Downloadable files are made available in &quot;AStyleWx
        Test Program&quot;. Refer to that section for more information. </p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleWx&quot;&nbsp; "$HOME/astylewx&quot;
        </strong></p>

    <h4>AStyleWxTest</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleTest contains the unit test programs and test scripts for AStyleWx.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>
        This project requires the AStyleWx project to compile. In addition, the test program requires Google Mock and
        Google Test described below.</p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleWxTest"&nbsp; "$HOME/astylewxtest"
        </strong></p>

    <h4>Gogle Mock and Google Test</h4>

    <p>
        Google Mock and Google Test is the Google multi-platform framework for writing C++ unit tests.
        It is available at <a href="https://github.com/google/googlemock" target="_blank" title="open new window">GitHub</a>.
        It can be downloaded as a zip file by pressing the &quot;Download ZIP&quot; button. The defalt is to download
        the master development branch. The latest stable release can be obtained by selecting Branch, tags, then select
        the latest release. For release 1.7 and older, googlemock has not been transfered to the googletest repository.
        Download googletest from the current GitHub repository. Then get the same release of googlemock <a href="https://github.com/google/googlemock"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">here</a>.</p>
    <p>
        The Artistic Style project files are set up to use googletest and googlemock installed in the top level folder
        as indicated above. The library compile for googlemock includes googletest. The library compile for googletest
        includes only googletest. The AStyle test programs have their own project files for compiling the test platform.
        There are also compile projects in the google modules if you want to use them. They create a static library file
        that is linked with the test program. The google downloads contain instructions for using the package.</p>

    <h4>Visual Studio Test Explorer</h4>

    <p>
        Some of the test projects can be run in Visual Studio 2013 or 2015 using Vusual Studio Test Explorer.
        If there is a .gta.runsettings file in the solution directory for a test project, the test will run in the 
        Test Explorer.</p>
    <p>
        The &quot;Google Test Adapter&quot; extension must be installed from the &quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Extensions
        and Updates&quot; menu. After restarting Visual Studio the test window is activated from the &quot;Test&quot;
        &gt; &quot;Windows&quot; &gt; &quot;Test Explorer&quot; menu option. After compiling, the tests will appear in
        the test window. They may then be run from the &quot;Test Explorer&quot; window or from the &quot;Test&quot; menu
        options.</p>
    <p>
        Test Explorer may be used for other test projects by adding a proper .gta.runsettings file to the solution directory,
        AStyleTest\build\vs2015 (or vs2013).</p>
    <p>
        The tests can also be run as a command line program by using the standard debug or run buttons on the menu or
        toolbar.</p>
