# Valgrind suppression file for AStyleTestLib.
#
# Suppression for  utf8ToUtf16.
# Two errors - Addr1 and Addr2.
# From the struct AStyleMainUtf16F2.
# The function is called to compute text16 and options16.
# The function assigns "wcConv = wcOut".
# wcOut doesn't change while wcConv is modified by iconv.
# Referencing wcConv, which hasn't had memory allocated,
#     apparentlt causes the problem.
